    "Hamiltonian systems are a class of dynamical systems governed by the Hamiltonian function, which represents the total energy of the systemâ€”kinetic and potential energy. These systems are a cornerstone of theoretical physics and are essential for understanding mechanics, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Definition of a Hamiltonian System\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hamiltonian system can be defined on a symplectic manifold, where the state of the system is described by coordinates $(q_1, \\ldots, q_n, p_1, \\ldots, p_n)$. Here $q_i$ are the generalized coordinates and $p_i$ are the conjugate momenta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hamiltonian Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian $H$ is a function, usually representing the total energy of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = T + V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is the potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Reversal Symmetry**: If the system evolves forward in time, then reversing the direction of time will return the system to its initial state.\n",
    "- **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy (Hamiltonian) is conserved if $H$ does not explicitly depend on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Hamilton's Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Hamilton's equations describe the time evolution of the system and are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\dot{q}_i = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i} $\n",
    "$ \\dot{p}_i = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i} $\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations ensure that the flow of the system in phase space is symplectic, preserving the symplectic structure of the manifold.\n"
